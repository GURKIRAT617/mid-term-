      But for some of us, an online friendship is no less meaningful. This is
      amazing in the ways that people can be united based on common interests
      regardless of how many miles separate them from each other. Online
      platforms, however can provide a level of anonymity that people would not
      have in person as well thus allowing them to be more open, where they feel
      like it is less exposing their true self. Some nice friends and
      understanding to be found online

      The value of friendships, whether online or in-person, can vary greatly from person 
      to person. While some may find that online connections 
      lack depth, others cherish the relationships they form online. Each type of friendship can fulfill different needs and provide varying levels of
       support, highlighting the importance of understanding and respecting diverse perspectives on friendship.
