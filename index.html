    <h1>Online vs. In-Person Friendship</h1>
    <h2>disagree</h2>
    <p>
        But for some of us, an online friendship is no less meaningful. This is amazing in the ways
         that people can be united based on common interests regardless of how many miles separate
          them from each other. Online platforms, however can provide a level of anonymity that 
          people would not have in person as well thus allowing them to be more open, where they 
          feel like it is less exposing their true self. Some nice friends and understanding to be
           found online
